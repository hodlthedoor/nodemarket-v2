@title HyperCycle Share ERC1155, revenue sharing contract.
@author Barry Rowe, Rodolfo Cova 
@notice This contract is a mechanism to share revenue for participants in the HyperCycle system.
      
        HyperCycle is a network of AI computation nodes offering different AI services in a 
        decentralized manner. In this system, there are license holders, token holders, hardware
        operators, and AI developers. Using the HyperCycleSwapV2 contract, an amount of HyPC (erc20)
        can be swapped for a cHyPC (containerized HyPC) token, which can then point towards a
        license (HyperCycleLicense) NFT id. At this point, the owner of this license can assign
        their license to some hardware running the HyperCycle Node Manager, and can from then
        on accept AI service requests on the network. 

        While all of this can be done by a single user, there are benefits to dividing up the
        responsibilities of each party, so a user can participate as a license holder, token holder,
        hardware operator, or AI developer. This is where the HyperCycle Share contracts come into
        play. The HyperCycleShareTokens contract is an ERC1155 contract that accepts a deposit of
        a license NFT and a cHyPC NFT, and creates two new tokens: a wealth token, and a revenue
        token. While the license and cHyPC are locked in the new Share, revenue can be deposited
        into the HyperCycleShareTokens by the hardware manager (that is, using the node manager
        software) with the depositRevenue() method. After some HyPC has been deposited this way,
        the revenue becomes locked for a minimum waiting period (for example, 7 days), after which,
        this revenue can be unlocked, and at that point, owners of the revenue token can claim 
        their portion of the share's income by using the claimRevenue() method. This will update 
        their withdrawable amount of HyPC that they can then withdraw from the contract. The revenue
        deposit delay is useful for ensuring more fairness of the revenue sharing. For instance,
        without a delay, the hardware operator could buy a lot of revenue tokens from an exchange,
        then make a huge revenue deposit into the contract, and then immediately claim their revenue
        and then sell the revenue tokens back to the exchange. With a delay period, the hardware
        operator would have to hold onto those tokens for the 7 day period, and with the pending
        deposit coming through, the revenue token price would increase (similar to dividend yielding
        stocks when leading up to the day a dividend will be paid out). The other holders of the
        revenue tokens can sell their tokens at the higher price, and then buy back the revenue
        tokens after the revenue is unlocked and claimable by the contract, when the price is lower.
        This counteracts the advantage the hardware operator,or users who would front run a deposit
        transaction, would have.

        Since revenue tokens can be transferred at any time, while revenue is collected only on the 
        claimRevenue call, whenever a transfer of revenue tokens happens, a claimRevenue call is 
        made for both the sender and receiver of the tokens first via the safeTransferFrom ERC1155 
        overrides defined at the end of the contract. This prevents the following situation:
        suppose Alice and Bob have 50% of the revenue tokens each, and the contract earns 1000 HyPC.
        Alice then sends Bob half of her revenue tokens. Bob now owns 75% of the revenue tokens and
        can claim 75% of the 1000 HyPC, even though the 1000 HyPC was deposited when Alice owned
        50% of those tokens. 

        The claimRevenue hook on the transfer of revenue tokens fixes this issue by forcing the
        revenue to be claimed whenever revenue tokens are transferred between parties. In effect,
        the issue is that revenue tokens are only fungible if they have collected revenue at the
        same time (if Alice claims revenue on her tokens while Bob has not, then these tokens
        are not equivalent to each other). If both holders of the tokens have collected at the
        same time however, then these tokens are indeed equivalent.

        Besides the revenue tokens, there are also the wealth tokens. In this contract they do not
        have any special usage, but are intended for use in future contracts (for example: a share
        manager contract) that can use them for governance functions. Right now, the current contract
        is intended to be used either via a multi-sig wallet with a general delgation mechanism 
        (eg: gnosis), or more likely via an external manager contract that interfaces with this 
        contract. In that case, the license holder and cHyPC holders would use the manager contract
        to create the share and divide the wealth and revenue tokens amongst themselves, or other
        parties, using governing mechanisms inside the manager contract.

        If the original creator of the share (or someone that had the share transferred to them) 
        decides to cancel the share itself by calling the cancelShareTokens() method, then the 
        original license and cHyPC NFTs are sent back to the creator (or new owner), and future
        deposits to share are halted. At this time, owners of the revenue tokens can claim their 
        last amounts of HyPC, and withdraw their HyPC from the contract.

        As well, while the typical use case is that the original creator of the share deposits 
        both the license and cHyPC tokens into the share contract, there are some use cases where 
        it might make sense to only deposit the license instead. This could be the case where 
        this creator is a smart contract that used the CrowdFundHYPCPoolV2 contract get an 
        assignment pointed to the license Id. In this case, the smart contract would have an 
        external guarantee that the license has backing but does not own the cHyPC itself. 
        In this case, a share can be created instead with a cHyPC id of 0, which will bypass the 
        cHyPC retrieval and assignment in that case. 
 
        Finally, there's also a message function to allow the owner of a share to set a message
        associated to this share. This is mainly intended for future manager contracts to use.
