    1. Inefficient Storage Manipulation
    Problem: Uses storage arrays heavily for token management, which is gas-inefficient.
    Impact: Increases transaction costs dramatically, especially as the number of tokens grows.

    2. Misuse of storage
    Problem: Excessive use of storage type where memory would suffice, particularly in functions that are read-intensive.
    Impact: Unnecessarily high gas costs due to frequent and avoidable read/write operations to storage.

    3. Complex and Unstructured Logic
    Problem: Overly complex functions for token management with unclear separation of concerns.
    Impact: Hard to maintain and audit, increasing the likelihood of bugs and security vulnerabilities.


    @title  HyperCycle SwapV2 contract.
    @author Barry Rowe, David Liendo, Rodolfo Cova
    @notice This contract is an updated version of the c_HyPC/SwapV1 contract for HyperCycle. While the
            original contract allowed a user to swap 2^19 (524288) HyPC (ERC20) for a c_HyPC.19 token
            (ERC721), this contract allows for swapping lower powers of 2 of HyPC (known as the level 
            of the c_HyPC token), to get a correspondingly lower c_HyPC token. As an example swapping 
            2^19 HyPC will give a c_HyPC at level 19, while swapping 2^18 HyPC will give a c_HyPC at 
            level 18, and so on.

            Once HyPC is swapped for a c_HyPC NFT, it can assign a number or a string to the token.
            This acts as a way to have HyPC backing an assignment string or number, and will typically
            be used for HyperCycle licenses inside a separate contract. Unlike with the V1 contract
            system, V2's assignments focus on assigning numbers to the c_HyPC tokens instead of strings, 
            so that these assignments can be aggregated together to give more flexibility over the
            amount of backing that is given to a license number. This total backing amount can then
            be returned by the getAssignmentTargetNumber function. Assigning a string can be done 
            instead, though this is primarily a backwards compatibility option for contracts using
            swapV1 interfaces.

            Finally, the actual c_HyPC license numbers themselves are part of a branch of a binary
            tree with integers at each node, using the convention that the left child of a node will
            have two times the number of its parent while the right child has this number plus one.
            Each c_HyPC token is guaranteed to have a unique number in this tree. This impacts the
            swapping logic in that while we can ensure that there will always be enough c_HyPCs that
            can be swapped for in the contract, we can not guarantee that they will be high level
            tokens. For instance, if there are 4096 level 19 tokens, and then 8192 level 18 tokens
            are swapped for, then there would be no more level 19 tokens left to swap for in the
            future since they all needed to be split to create the 8192 level 18 tokens. Even if
            we allowed for merging (ie: unsplitting) of tokens, then we wouldn't be able to guarantee
            that neighboring c_HyPC in the tree would be available to merge together to recreate
            a parent token.

            To help mitigate this, we first have the aggregation of targetNumbers for assignments
            as previously mentioned. Secondly, we also have limits on how many tokens can be split
            down to the lower levels at a time, with only at most `LEVEL_LIMIT` amount of tokens being 
            allowed on a level after a splitting operation. In order to fill up more tokens inside
            the contract at that level then those tokens would have to be swapped with HyPC. This 
            means that to fill up level 18 for instance with 8192 tokens, then a user would have 
            to lock away nearly the entire supply of HyPC (2^31) into the swap contract itself, 
            all at once.

            Finally, to help with reducing the number of transactions needed to fill up the levels
            array (and thereby available tokens to be swapped), by default, the tokens available
            to be swapped for on a given level will only be minted by the contract when a user
            asks to swap for a given token. So, the root level 19 tokens when added to the contract
            via the addRootToken call, are in actuality only allocated for that level and are not
            physically minted into an actual ERC721 token until they are actually swapped for with
            a swap call.
